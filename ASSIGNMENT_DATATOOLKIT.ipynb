        "1.What is NumPy, and why is it widely used in Python\n",
        "NumPy is python library which is used for mathematical computation (numerical)\n",
        "it is widely used for arrays multidimensional arrays and matrices.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. How does broadcasting work in NumPy\n",
        "Broadcasting allows NumPy to perform operations on arrays of different shapes.\n",
        "It automatically expands the smaller array to match the shape of the larger one\n",
        "without copying data, enabling element-wise operations efficiently\n",
        "\n",
        "3.What is a Pandas DataFrame\n",
        "A DataFrame is a two-dimensional labeled data structure with columns of potentially different types.\n",
        "It's like a spreadsheet or SQL table and is one of the most commonly used structures in data analysis with Pandas.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.Explain the use of the groupby() method in Pandas\n",
        "The groupby() method is used to group data based on values in one or more columns.\n",
        "It allows you to perform aggregate functions like sum, mean, or count on each group.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.Why is Seaborn preferred for statistical visualizations\n",
        "Seaborn is built on Matplotlib and provides a higher-level interface for creating attractive and informative statistical graphics.\n",
        "It integrates well with Pandas and supports complex visualizations like violin plots, boxplots, and heatmaps with minimal code.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. What are the differences between NumPy arrays and Python lists\n",
        "NumPy arrays are more efficient in terms of performance and memory.\n",
        "They support vectorized operations.\n",
        "They require elements to be of the same data type, unlike Python lists.\n",
        "\n",
        "7.What is a heatmap, and when should it be used\n",
        "A heatmap is a data visualization technique that uses color to represent the values of a matrix.\n",
        "It's especially useful for visualizing correlation matrices or any data that’s better understood through patterns and intensities\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What does the term “vectorized operation” mean in NumPy\n",
        "It refers to performing operations on entire arrays rather than individual elements using loops.\n",
        "Vectorized operations are faster and more concise\n",
        "9.How does Matplotlib differ from Plotly\n",
        "Matplotlib is a static plotting library while Plotly is interactive.\n",

        "\n",
        "13.Why is handling missing data important in Pandas\n",
